# Dan & Ches

Website for our wedding using the react.js starter. It's not exactly tidy, but is still trivial and will mature as the 
application gets more complex

## Building distribution

`react-scripts` is used to build the application, although you can simply run `npm build` which will defer execution to
`react-scripts`

## Running

You can either serve the files built by `npm build`, or you can run it in development mode which will hot-load changes 
as the filesystem changes by running `npm run`
